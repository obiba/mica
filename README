Mica is a powerful software application used to create web portals for epidemiological study consortia.

Using Mica, consortia can build personalised web sites for publishing their research activities and their membership.
Mica includes many domain-specific features such as study catalogues, data dictionary browsers, on-line data access request forms, community tools (forums, events, news) and others. Moreover, Mica includes a powerful data search engine
that allows authenticated researchers to perform distributed queries on the content of each individual study data collection hosted by the OBiBa Opal database software.

Mica is based on the content management software Drupal (http://www.drupal.org) used by millions of websites worldwide. As such, a webmaster benefits from all the power and flexibility of Drupal, as well as the support of an extended developer community.
